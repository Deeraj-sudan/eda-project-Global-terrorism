Conclusions

Challenges faced:

Collecting meaningful data: With so much data available, it’s difficult to dig down and access the insights that are needed most.
Unknown Values: Dealing with the unknown values in the data is a task in itself to analyze in the best way.
Visual representation of data: To understand data it often needs to be visually presented in graphs or charts. It’s difficult to build them manually. Taking the time to pull information from multiple areas is a time consuming.
