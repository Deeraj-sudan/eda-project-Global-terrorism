Challenges faced:

Collecting meaningful data: With so much data available, it’s difficult to dig down and access the insights that are needed most.
Unknown Values: Dealing with the unknown values in the data is a task in itself to analyze in the best way.
Visual representation of data: To understand data it often needs to be visually presented in graphs or charts. It’s difficult to build them manually. Taking the time to pull information from multiple areas is a time consuming.


Conclusion:

There has been a significant increase in terrorist activities across the world since 2008, with the year 2014 experiencing the highest number of incidents. This was followed by 2015, 2016, and 2017, with Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan being the major contributors to these incidents.
From 1970 to 2017, Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan were the countries with the highest number of attacks.
From 2008 to 2012, there was a consistent number of attacks observed worldwide.
Terrorists top most target are private citizens(Armed Assault) and Govt. establishment such as Military, police and Govt.(General) has been in the top 5 list. India has also the same trend.
Taliban has been the most active terrorist group in the decade 2011-2017. We can say the reason behind sharp rise in terrorist activities after 2008 and biggest contributor to terrorism in South Asia (specifically Afghanistan) is Taliban alone.
Middle east North africa and South Asia has been the most affected region(Taliban)
Like rest of the world, India has also experienced a significant increase in terrorist activities since 2008, with incidents nearly tripling.
Total casualties in India have been more between 1988-92 and 2006-2010. After 2010 there is a significant decrease.
Srinagar has been identified as the most frequently attacked city, with Amritsar ranking third, followed by Sopore in sixth place, Ludhiana in seventh, Anantnag in eighth, and Jammu in eleventh. These findings suggest that the Taliban's influence in India is evident, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir, which has experienced the highest number of attacks
Top 10 most affected state contribute 31% in total population of India however 5 states in that list- Jammu & Kashmir, Manipur, Assam, Meghalaya, Jharkhand (total population share in India=6.78%) accounts for 38% of attacks.
